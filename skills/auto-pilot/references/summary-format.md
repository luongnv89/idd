# Final Summary format

When the loop ends (for any reason), print a structured step-by-step summary
showing each iteration's outcome. Each iteration is tagged with one of six
categorical outcomes.

## Outcome meanings

| Outcome | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `merged` | PR passed review and was merged cleanly. |
| `left_open` | PR was created but not merged — either the mode forbids merge, the merge was blocked (CI/conflicts), or unresolved review issues prevented merge under the current mode. |
| `partial_followup` | PR was merged with unresolved review issues; a follow-up issue captures the remaining work. Only reachable in `aggressive` mode with `merge_partial: true`. |
| `blocked_by_dependency` | PR was created and reviewed but cannot merge until a `Depends on #N` / `Blocked by #N` reference is itself merged. PR is left open and unchanged, the issue is skipped for the rest of the session, and **the loop continues to the next eligible issue**. The user merges the dependency and a later `/auto-pilot` run picks the blocked PR back up. |
| `failed` | The resolver subagent failed before a PR could be created (or another fatal step failed). |
| `skipped` | Issue was skipped before resolution started — already resolved, blocked by labels/dependencies, in the `--skip` list, or assigned to another user. |

  Result:                  {COMPLETED / PAUSED / LIMIT REACHED}

  Remaining:               {remaining_count} open issues
  Next action:             /auto-pilot to continue
```

If batch analysis was used (explicit issue list), use the same layout with two
deltas: suffix the header with `(batch mode)` and add an
`Analysis: ✓ pass ({N} issues, {batches} batch groups)` line directly under the
header. Everything else — the per-iteration rows, the count block, and the
footer — is identical.
